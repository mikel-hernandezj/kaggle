In this repository I upload some notebooks with various analysis I performed to fultil some kaggle tasks.

This folder contains some EDA and data visualization of a Telecom users dataset and some ML classifiers spot-check and development to find the best model to predict the churn of a user of a telecommunication company based on the rest of the attributes.
